## What is Argo?

Argo consists of a set of open source tools for deploying and running applications and workloads on Kubernetes, including:
* [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/): Kubernetes-native workflow engine supporting DAG and step-based workflows.
* [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/): Declarative continuous delivery with a fully-loaded UI.
* [Argo Rollouts](https://argoproj.github.io/rollouts/): Advanced Kubernetes deployment strategies such as Canary and Blue-Green made easy.
* [Argo Events](https://argoproj.github.io/events/): Event based dependency management for Kubernetes.

In addition, [argoproj-labs](https://github.com/argoproj-labs) is a separate GitHub org for community contributions related to the Argo ecosystem.

<a name="books" />

## Books

* [GitOps and Kubernetes](https://www.manning.com/books/gitops-and-kubernetes) teaches you how to use Git and the GitOps methodology to manage a Kubernetes cluster. The book interleaves theory with practice, presenting core Ops concepts alongside easy-to-implement techniques so you can put GitOps into action. Learn to develop pipelines that trace changes, roll back mistakes, and audit container deployment.
* [Distributed Machine Learning Patterns](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/distributed-ml-patterns) teaches you how to take machine learning models from your personal laptop to large distributed clusters. Youâ€™ll explore key concepts and patterns behind successful distributed machine learning systems, and learn technologies like TensorFlow, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, and Argo Workflows with real-world scenarios and hands-on projects.
